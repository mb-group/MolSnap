Subsequently, we evaluated the pharmacokinetic properties (PK） of A04 and A11 (ZJK-807） in mice.After intraperitoneal (IP) administration at a dose of $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g } ,$ the half-lives ( $\\stackrel { \\prime } { T } _ { 1 / 2 } = 1 . 8 5$ and $1 . 6 7 \\ \\mathrm { h }$ ）of both compounds were similar. However, the maximum plasma concentration of ZJK807 ( $\\mathrm { ^ { \\prime } } C _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } = 7 0 8 6 \\pm 8 8 3 ~ \\mathrm { n g / m L } \\mathrm { ^ { \\prime } }$ ）was approximately 10 times higher than that of A04 $( C _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } = 7 2 2 \\pm 9 2 ~ \\mathrm { n g / m L } )$ ，and furthermore, the plasma exposure level of ZJK-807( $\\mathrm { \\Delta A U C _ { \\mathrm { l a s t } } = }$ $2 6 1 0 3 \\pm 3 6 9 1 \\mathrm { h } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { n g } / \\mathrm { m L } ,$ ）was approximately 7 times higher than that of A04 $\\mathrm { \\langle A U C _ { l a s t } = 3 8 8 3 \\pm 1 4 7 \\ h { \\cdot } n g / m L \\rangle }$ (Table 5). The above data suggest that compounds with rigid linkers have superior PK properties compared to flexible linkers.To address the short half-life of ZJK-807 following IP administration, we explored alternative administration routes to prolong its retention in mice.Following subcutaneous (SC) administration at $3 0 \\mathrm { ~ \\ m g / k g } ,$ ZJK-807 exhibited favorable PK properties, including $T _ { 1 / 2 } = 7 . 4 3 \\pm 0 . 6 9 \\mathrm { ~ h } ,$ $C _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } = 9 8 6 9 \\pm 2 6 4 9 ~ \\mathrm { n g / m L } ,$ $\\mathrm { A U C _ { L A S T } } = 2 6 3 4 6 \\pm 3 9 9 9 \\mathrm { h \\cdot n g / m L } ,$ $\\mathrm { M R T _ { I N F - o b s } } = 6 . 0 8 \\pm 0 . 5 7 \\mathrm { h \\Omega }$ (Table 5). Our data suggest that the half-life of ZJK-807 by SC administration at $3 0 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ is approximately 4-fold longer than that by $\\mathrm { I P }$ administration.We expected to optimize the PK parameters of CRBN-PROTAC while maintaining a high degradation efficacy.To evaluate this，we administered ZJK807 and 8o subcutaneously at $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ and assessed its PK parameters. Comparative analysis revealed that ZJK-807 exhibited approximately 2.2-fold higher plasma exposure than 8o when both compounds were administered subcutaneously at the same dose (Table S2).The improvement in PK properties of ZJK-807 compared to 8o is similar to the difference in PK properties between compound A04 and ZJK-807. We speculate that this improvement is due to the introduction of a rigid linker, which enhances the solubility and stability of the compoud.42 ",

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA） further revealed that ZJK-807 significantly down-regulated a cluster of genes associated with the RAS and MAPK signaling pathways，a pattern similar to that observed with MRTX1133 (Figure 8G). Pathway analysis using the KEGG database identified the top 20 significantly enriched biological pathways, showing that DEGs were notably enriched in pathways such as the cell cycle and MAPK signaling following ZJK-807 treatment (Figure 81), consistent with the results from MRTX1133 treatment (Figure 8H).Notably, ZJK-807 also enriched pathways related to the TNF signaling pathway,and Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes.
