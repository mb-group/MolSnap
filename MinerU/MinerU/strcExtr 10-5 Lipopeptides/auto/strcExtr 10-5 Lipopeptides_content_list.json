CA-297274 and exhibited potent activity against Zymoseptoria tritici, the causal agent of septoria tritici blotch of wheat. Isolation and structure elucidation performed using HR-MS/MS,1D and 2D NMR, and Marfey's analyses, revealed that structures contained an Asp-Gly-Asp-Gly motif in the peptide scaffold, typical of calcium-dependent antibiotics. Genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the strain uncovered a biosynthetic gene cluster consistent with the production of these compounds and helped to correct the absolute configuration determined by Marfey's analysis of some amino acid residues. The isolated metabolites displayed notable antifungal activity against Z. tritici， with minimum inhibitory concentration values in the micromolar range (Compound 4, 9.5 $\\mu \\mathbf { M } ,$ ，and calcium-dependent antibacterial activity against methicilin-resistant ",

The $^ { 1 3 } \\mathrm { C }$ NMR spectrum displayed fifteen carbonyl carbon signals between $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ 172.4 and 165.6; two $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ methine carbons at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ 143.7 and 124.4, eleven $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 3 }$ methine signals (eight from the $\\alpha \\mathrm { C }$ of the chiral amino acids between $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } } 6 0 . 0$ and 47.6, two from the Val and Ile at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ 30.9 and 35.6,respectively,and one from the acyl side chain at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ 27.6), twenty-three $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ methylene signals (three from the $\\alpha \\mathrm { C }$ of the Gly residues and the remaining twenty assigned to the different amino acid side chains and the lipidic chain，all resonating at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ between 47.5 and 20.7),and finally six methyl signals (two from Ile,two from Val,and two from the fatty acid chain between $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } } 2 2 . 9$ and 10.8). The $^ 1 \\mathrm { H }$ spectra of compound 1 exhibited ten signals of amide exchangeable hydrogens between $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } ~ 8 . 3$ and $7 . 7 \\ \\mathrm { p p m }$ ，The lipophilic moiety of the peptide was identified as E-12-methyltridec-2-enoic acid (MTEA） using COSY and HMBC correlations and comparison of the NMR data with those reported for other glycinocins.29 A coupling constant between the $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 2 }$ methine hydrogens of $1 5 . 4 \\ \\mathrm { H z }$ confirmed an $E$ configuration for the double bond. The connection between amide hydrogens and $\\alpha \\mathrm { C }$ of the amino acids was deduced from the COSY spectrum. The chemical shifts of the side chain of each amino acid were determined by TOCSY NMR data, following the cross peaks from amide hydrogensand $\\alpha \\mathrm { C }$ hydrogens. Inter-residue connection and amino acid sequence were deduced from key NOESY correlations between the amide hydrogen of each amino acid and the $\\alpha \\mathrm { C }$ hydrogen of the adjacent amino acid (Figure 2).The link between the acyl side chain and the aspartic residue was established by the presence of a NOESY cross peak between the hydrogen of the αC of the acyl side chain at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ 5.92 and the amide hydrogen of the first Asp residue at $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } }$ 8.15.HMBC combined with NOESY spectra determined the atachment of the first Asp residue to Dap, linking the side chain with the cyclic peptidic core.HRMS/MS data additionally confirmed the following sequence MTEAAsp-Dap-Pipe-Gly-Asp-Gly-Asp-Gly-Val-Ile-Pro (Figure 1). The HSQC spectrum reveals the presence of two conformations for the Pipe residue (Figures S28 and S29). The presence of various conformers has been described for other similar peptides such as laspartomycin C,a diastereoisomer of glycinocin $\\mathbf { A } . ^ { 3 3 }$ A comparison of laspartomycin C with 1 revealed its high structural similarity.Key differences include the presence of D-Thr in laspartomycin C instead of D-Val in 1 and minor differences in the FA chain. According to the NMR data, the two tertiary amide bonds in cyclic amino acids were found to have a trans geometry for Pro and cis for Pipe in the major conformer. This was supported by the chemical shifts of $\\beta \\mathrm { C } \\left( \\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } } 2 9 . 7 \\right)$ and $\\gamma \\mathrm { C }$ $\\left( \\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } } 2 4 . 8 \\right)$ of the Pro residue.34 The NMR signals observed at $\\chi \\mathrm { C } \\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } 4 . 7 5 / \\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ 56.4 and εC $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { H } } 2 . 8 6 $ 4.33/ $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { C } }$ 39.9 positions of Pipe compared with rapamycin rotamers confirmed that it was in thecis configuration.3sOnly the chemical shifts for the main conformer are detailed in Tables 1 and 2.

Compared to 2, the NMR spectra of 3 showed key signals in HSQC accounting for the absence of the $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 3 }$ methylene signal of Dap and a new $\\mathsf { s p } ^ { 3 }$ methine signal, suggesting the replacement of Dap with a Dab residue，which was confirmed by COSY correlations. This replacement of a Dap with a Dab residue seems to provide additional rigidity to the structure，making the differences between the conformers more evident in the NMR spectra (Figure S45).
